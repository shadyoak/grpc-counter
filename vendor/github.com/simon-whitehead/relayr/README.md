## RelayR

RelayR is a Go package that provides easy-to-use real time communication APIs for Go web applications.

#### Current version: 0.2.1

Please see CHANGELOG.md for details about the changes between versions.

### Installation

#### IMPORTANT:

RelayR relies on the [Gorilla WebSocket package](https://github.com/gorilla/websocket) for WebSocket support. Please head over to that repository, give it a star, and ``go get` it into your `GOPATH`.

Also important: RelayR currently only supports WebSockets. Server Sent Events and Long Polling options are on the roadmap.

#### Installing RelayR

After you have installed the [Gorilla WebSocket package](https://github.com/gorilla/websocket), you can run the following:

    go get https://github.com/simon-whitehead/relayr

### Examples

The `/examples` directory contains three examples.

The first one is a simple Server -> Client timestamp push. The server will push the current time down to all connected clients every second.

It looks like this:

The second one is a replica of the famous SignalR sample, "High-Frequency Realtime with SignalR" where a shape can be dragged around a browser and broadcast to all clients.

It looks like this:

The third one demonstrates Groups and membership. It allows clients to subscribe to groups and receive notifications that are pushed to groups they are subscribed to.

### Project status

This is very much a work in progress - some might say, pre-alpha. The code is horrible .. but it works. I am opening it up to the world early for feedback and contributions (in any form).

### Contributing

Please! Fork away .. improve it .. create a PR .. whatever you want to do. I am open to any and all help.

### Licence

This code is released under the Apache 2.0 licence.
